### A presentation by the P4 Language Consortium and ONF in conjunction with ANCS 2019 
    
#### Held at Cambridge, UK on September 23, 2019

EuroP4 2019 is the second P4 Language Consortium event in Europe.  
It aims to bring together P4 and P4->NetFPGA researchers from Europe and from around the world, and to foster the growth of the P4 Community.

Topics of an interest include, but are not limited to:
* All aspects of P4-based network protocol research including design, specification, verification, implementation, measurement, testing, and analysis.
* Contributions to network architecture using P4, e.g., specific algorithms and protocols for network virtualization or future Internet architectures.
* New applications and in-network computing enabled by P4
* P4-based and P4-NetFPGA based programmable data planes
* End-host networking with P4
* Tools and frameworks for development using P4
* Performance analysis and measurement of P4-based designs and systems
* Contributions to the evolution of the P4 language

Papers are available [here](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/srg/netos/projects/netfpga/conf/europ42019/)
(Please, note that papers are accessible at the moment only for EuroP4 participats)

        Abstract
        </summary>
	P4 programs can exhibit a series of undefined behaviours including inexistent 
	header accesses, infinite loops, parser errors, and so forth, much like C programs 
	can include use-after-free errors, out-of-bounds accesses and so forth. Such bugs 
	were found in most programs examined, be they small or large. A part of my talk 
	will discuss what might happen if buggy programs are deployed in practice by 
	examining how different P4 targets behave when undefined behaviours are present 
	in P4 programs, finding that a range of exploits are possible whose severity 
	depends on the target.
	Luckily, P4 is not Turing-complete and automated approaches at finding such bugs 
	have been proposed and are quite promising. Works such as p4v, Vera or p4-assert 
	can find all bugs before deployment as long as the programmer can provide table 
	rules that will appear in practice or provide a control plane invariant which 
	are predicates that table rules will obbey at runtime. Still, these tools place a 
	significant verification burden on the programmer, and it the jury is still out 
	on whether they will be used in practice.
	In the remainder of my talk I will cover existing approaches to find bugs in P4 
	programs, as well as presenting new work towards elliminating the need for programmer 
	input in the verification process.

        Biography
        </summary>
	Costin Raiciu is Associate Professor at University Politehnica of Bucharest where 
	he leads the Netsys group. Costin finished his PhD at UCL in 2011. His current 
	research focus is on network verification. In his past work, Costin was one of the 
	main people behind the development, implementation and standardization of Multipath 
	TCP, a protocol that is now deployed by Apple and Samsung on their mobile devices. 
	Recently, Costin worked on NDP, which is a radical redesign of the datacenter networking 
	stack (ACM SIGCOMM 2017).
