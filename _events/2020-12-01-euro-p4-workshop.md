### A presentation by the P4 Language Consortium and ONF in conjunction with CoNEXT 2020

#### Held in Barcelona, Spain on December 1, 2020

EuroP4 2020 is the third P4 Language Consortium event in Europe.
It aims to bring together P4 and P4->NetFPGA researchers from Europe and from around the world, and to foster the growth of the P4 Community.

Topics of an interest include, but are not limited to:
* All aspects of P4-based network protocol research, including design, specification, verification, implementation, measurement, testing, and analysis.
* Design, analysis, and evaluation of network architectures using P4 as a basis, e.g., specific algorithms and protocols for network virtualization or future Internet architectures.
* New applications enabled by P4, including in-network computing and Big Data, Video and Virtual Reality, Mobile and Wireless Network Protocols and Applications, Ubiquitous computing, Internet-of-Things and Smart Cities.
* Secure, reliable and dependable P4-based systems, including all aspects of monitoring, verification, debugging and troubleshooting networks enabled by P4.
* P4-based and P4-NetFPGA based programmable data planes.
* P4 end-host networking, offloading transport- and application-layer protocols to P4-enabled hardware.
* Tools and frameworks for development using P4.
* Contributions to the evolution of the P4 language.

### Participation

As a consequence of the current situation of the COVID-19 pandemic and similar to CoNEXT'20, EuroP4'20 will be a fully virtual (online) event. Please follow the updates on the CoNEXT'20 and our website for the details.

### Submission instructions

EuroP4 solicits full-length technical papers (6 pages including all references and appendices) and short poster/demo papers (extended abstracts of 2 pages at most). Submissions should adhere to the ACM formatting requirements (2-column, 10pt ACM format). EuroP4 will use a double-blind review process.

Authors are required to present accepted papers at the workshop in order for the paper to appear in the proceedings and the ACM digital library. Exceptions from this policy for truly mitigating situations must be approved by the TPC Chairs before the beginning of the workshop.
