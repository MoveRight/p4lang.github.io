### Hosted by the P4 Language Community and <br /> Open Networking Foundation  
#### Held Virtually on *Tuesday, April 28 through Thursday, April 30, 2020* 

We have made the difficult decision to cancel the "in-person" 2020 P4 P4 and Programmable Forwarding Summit at Stanford due to the potential risk of the COVID-19 virus.  We feel this is in the best interest of the entire P4 community. As an alternative, we are planning an **expert roundtable series** to bring exciting keynotes, plenary, and panel discussions.  We plan on capturing the planned presentations and discussions with technical experts using a lively roundtable format and make these sessions available as a series for on-demand consumption.

With this new format, we will **continue to accept talk proposals** through the [P4 Summit submission website](https://summit-cfp-2020.p4.org/); however, due to the change in format, we can no longer accept demo or poster proposals. The P4 Summit TPC will shortlist talks for the expert roundtable series from the submissions.

### Call for Proposals (We have extended the deadline by one week for talk proposals)
**Submission site**: <https://summit-cfp-2020.p4.org/> <br />
**Deadline**: March 20, 2020 11:59pm PT (firm) <br />
**Notification**: April 3, 2020

All CFP submissions will be reviewed by a technical program committee chaired by Anirudh Sivaraman (New York University) and Larry Peterson (Open Networking Foundation). To submit a talk proposal, please upload a one-page PDF to the submission site before the deadline. Please provide sufficient detail to help us fairly evaluate your submission, e.g., a single short paragraph will likely be insufficient. A good submission will describe the problem youâ€™re solving, how P4 or programmable forwarding helps you solve the problem, what the solution is, and how you evaluated it.
_*Authors should not submit talk proposals describing work that is undergoing SIGCOMM'20 review. This is to avoid violating SIGCOMM'20's author anonymity requirements._
