### Hosted by the P4 Language Community and <br /> Open Networking Foundation  

We are planning a 'P4 expert roundtable series' to bring exciting keynotes, plenary, and panel discussions to the P4 community.  We will capture planned presentations and discussions with technical experts using a lively, roundtable format. These sessions will be available to everyone as a series for on-demand consumption, allowing us to reach a much broader audience from anywhere in the world.

With this new format, we will continue accepting talk proposals (only) through the same [P4 Summit submission website](https://summit-cfp-2020.p4.org/).  This on-demand approach will replace the 'in-person' P4 Summit planned for Stanford at the end of April. However, our P4 Summit program chairs and technical program committee will continue to review all submissions and shortlist talks for the P4 expert roundtable series.

### Call for Proposals (Submission deadline extended by one week)
**Submission site**: <https://summit-cfp-2020.p4.org/> <br />
**Deadline**: March 20, 2020 11:59pm PT (firm) <br />
**Notification**: April 3, 2020

All CFP submissions will be reviewed by a technical program committee chaired by Anirudh Sivaraman (New York University) and Larry Peterson (Open Networking Foundation). To submit a talk proposal, please upload a one-page PDF to the submission site before the deadline. Please provide sufficient detail to help us fairly evaluate your submission, e.g., a single short paragraph will likely be insufficient. A good submission will describe the problem youâ€™re solving, how P4 or programmable forwarding helps you solve the problem, what the solution is, and how you evaluated it.
_*Authors should not submit talk proposals describing work that is undergoing SIGCOMM'20 review. This is to avoid violating SIGCOMM'20's author anonymity requirements._
