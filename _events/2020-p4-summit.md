### Hosted by the P4 Language Community and <br /> Open Networking Foundation  
#### Held at Stanford University on *Tuesday, April 28 through Thursday, April 30, 2020* 

We are excited to announce the new P4 and Programmable Forwarding Summit! With the growing interest and accelerated adoption of P4 and programmable forwarding across a growing number of use cases in networking, this year is being expanded to a three-day event, with day one comprised of tutorials and the following two days consisting of a workshop-style format. The breadth and depth of the content will include insightful keynotes; in-depth technical sessions on P4 and the tool chain; use cases for switching, NIC, and other network functions; hands-on tutorials; and live demonstrations of P4-enabled products. In moving to this new format, it will provide attendees a broader perspective on important developments over the past year, insights on what is coming next, and an opportunity to socialize with P4 community members. 

Put it on your calendar now and don't miss it!

### Call for Proposal
**Submission site**: <https://summit-cfp-2020.p4.org/> <br />
**Deadline**: March 13, 2020 11:59pm PT (firm) <br />
**Notification**: March 27, 2020

All CFP submissions will be reviewed by a technical program committee chaired by Anirudh Sivaraman (New York University) and Larry Peterson (Open Networking Foundation). To submit a proposal, please upload a one-page PDF to the submission site before the deadline. Please provide sufficient detail to help us fairly evaluate your submission, e.g., a single short paragraph will likely be insufficient. A good submission will describe the problem you’re solving, how P4 or programmable forwarding helps you solve the problem, what the solution is, how you evaluated it, and how you’ll be presenting it (poster, demo, or talk).
