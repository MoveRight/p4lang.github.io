### Hosted by the P4 Language Community and <br /> Open Networking Foundation  

We are planning to launch a 'P4 expert roundtable series' to bring exciting keynotes, plenary, and panel discussions to the P4 community.  This will be a 2-day event incorporating live webinars of keynote/s and Q&A, along with planned presentations and discussions with technical experts using a dynamic, roundtable format. These sessions will be available to everyone as a series for on-demand consumption, allowing us to reach a much broader audience from anywhere in the world.

We have made the difficult decision to cancel the "in-person" 2020 P4 and Programmable Forwarding Summit we had planned to host at Stanford in April, due to the potential risk of the COVID-19 virus. We feel this is in the best interest of the entire P4 community. We are enthusiastic about the new roundtable format and we expect that it will help expand our community reach and enable more extensive industry involvement.
