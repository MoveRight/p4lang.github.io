Please join me in congratulating the newly elected members of the P4 TST for 2020 - 2021: [Andy Fingerhut](https://wiki.opennetworking.org/display/COM/Andy+Fingerhut), [Stefan Heule](https://wiki.opennetworking.org/display/COM/Stefan+Heule) and [Robert Soule](https://wiki.opennetworking.org/display/COM/Robert+Soule)! 

All three have been involved with technical work on P4 for several years, and we are delighted that they have agreed to serve the community in a leadership role. They have each been elected to a 2-year term and will be responsible for overseeing and managing all the technical decisions within the P4 project, along with the continuing members of the TST. Larry Peterson is also joining the TST as an ex-officio member representing ONF. If you are wondering why you didn't receive a ballot, we had 3 open slots and 3 qualified nominees so an election was not needed. 

Please also join me in thanking outgoing members Nick McKeown, Guru Parulkar, and Jennifer Rexford for their service on the inaugural P4 TST. Nick and Jen were the founding members of the original P4.org board and have served the P4 community in a leadership role for the past 6 years. Guru joined the TST last year and has played an instrumental role in helping us navigate the transition from a grassroots project to a professional open-source organization. We are grateful for their leadership and service.

As the saying goes, no good deed goes unpunished... the ONF has created a new P4 Advisory Board and appointed Nick, Guru, and Jen as founding members, along with Amin Vahdat and me. The P4 Advisory Board will not be involved with day-to-day technical work on P4 but will provide strategic direction to the TST and will also serve as a liaison to the ONF Board.
